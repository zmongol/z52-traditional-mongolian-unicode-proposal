# Z52 Traditional Mongolian Unicode Proposal (WG2)

This repository contains a public PDF proposal for an element-based, deterministic encoding model for the Traditional Mongolian script (Z52).

## Main document
- **WG2_Unicode_Traditional_Mongolian_Z52_Proposal.pdf**

## What this proposal argues
- A parallel, element-based encoding model that coexists with the current Mongolian block (U+1800), without replacing legacy data.
- Deterministic written-form representation using a small, stable set of **52 atomic elements**.
- Composition is handled at input time (IME-centered), reducing reliance on complex font shaping and eliminating "agreement-driven" font behavior.

## Files in this repo
